#for this project i use oython and machine learning important libraries
#then we clean the data analyze the data preprocessing data
#data visualization by matplotlib seaborn pyplot etc.
#then we built the model and train ml model
#aplly various suitable ml algorithms on model
#test the model
#prediction the data
#compare the actual ands predicted data
#check performance of model by performance metrucs like r square mean absolute rror
